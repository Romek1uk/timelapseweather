7/11/2014:
- Raspberry Pi isn't working... Ordered a new one.

9/11/2014:
- OpenCV is unnecessary for what we're doing (and doesn't provide what we want by default)
- Easier to just get the metrics myself
- Wrote functions to get brightness/colour

10/11/2014:
- Wrote function to get brightness histogram

14/11/2014:
- Basic plan for code structure
- BrightnessHistogram now goes to 255 rather than 100.
- Created imagemetrics package
  - Brightness
  - Histogram
  - Hue
  - Image
- Started on the Weather part (done the constructor)

07/12/2014:
- Oops- no log in a while
- Everything will be machine learning, no more fixed classifier
- Using metrics to teach weka
- csv file has to be manipulated heavily to be used
- RandomForest doesn't work on string attributes
- All csv files require headers
