7/11/2014:
- Raspberry Pi isn't working... Ordered a new one.

9/11/2014:
- OpenCV is unnecessary for what we're doing (and doesn't provide what we want by default)
- Easier to just get the metrics myself
- Wrote functions to get brightness/colour

10/11/2014:
- Wrote function to get brightness histogram

14/11/2014:
- Basic plan for code structure
- BrightnessHistogram now goes to 255 rather than 100.
- Created imagemetrics package
  - Brightness
  - Histogram
  - Hue
  - Image
- Started on the Weather part (done the constructor)
