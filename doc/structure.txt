# Lots of pictures – one figure on every page (ish), so that everything that can be illustrated, is illustrated. Examiners read briefly, so pictures are well appreciated.

# 2.5k words for each of implementation and evaluation
# 2k each for intro and prep
# 1k for conclusion

# don't overwrite- be concise!
# short dissertations generally get marked better anyway (easier to understand and less bog-downing)

# start with preperation.
# introduction should be written LAST, as a question to the conclusionc
